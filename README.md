# herdr-voice

Voice control for [herdr](https://herdr.dev) using the OpenAI Realtime API.

Speak (or type) natural language; it drives herdr's socket API to create spaces, split
panes, apply layouts, and start/prompt coding agents — with a TUI showing the live
transcript, every tool call, and the resulting workspace state.

## Invoke

**`alt+p` then `m` — from inside herdr (including remote).** The binding runs
`bin/herdr-voice-summon` on the studio, which SSHes to the MacBook and opens the
floating HUD there. The HUD's tunnel dials back to the studio's herdr socket — so one
keystroke inside remote herdr gets you voice with a **real microphone on the machine
you're sitting at**. If the MacBook is unreachable, a herdr notification says so.

**Directly on the MacBook: `herdr-voice-mac`** (also Raycast-able). Same HUD.

### The HUD

A small (58×12) Ghostty window, top-right, floating above everything (title `voice`
misses the AeroSpace "herdr" tiling rule and hits the float catch-all; position is
computed per-launch into `~/.cache/herdr-voice/position.conf` since Ghostty can't
anchor top-right itself). Focus doesn't matter for voice — the app owns the mic
regardless of which window is focused.

```
 ◉ listening  ▁▃▆▅▂▆▂▄▁▁  remote
 » create a space called scratch and start…   ← live dictation
 you what agents are running?
 ✓ get_state
 ai  Reviewer is working; codex-2 is idle.
 ● mic · ● voice · ● text · ○ copy            ← clickable
 › type here…
```

Toggles — click them, or keys (keys work when the input line is empty):

| Control | Key | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `● mic` | `tab` | capture your audio on/off |
| `● voice` | `s` | play the agent's spoken replies on/off |
| `● text` | `t` | show/hide transcript + tool calls |
| `○ copy` | `c` / `C` | copy last exchange / whole session to clipboard |

Copying: `c`/`C` use `pbcopy` (works because the HUD runs locally). Mouse reporting is
on for the buttons, so plain drag-select is captured — hold **shift** to drag-select
natively, or just use `c`/`C`.

### Transcripts

Every session is persisted as JSONL to `~/.local/state/herdr-voice/transcripts/`
(`latest.jsonl` symlinks the current one) on whichever machine the app runs on:
user/assistant/tool/system entries with timestamps — reference them to tune prompts
and tool descriptions.

### Fallbacks

Full-screen TUI (spaces/agents panel): `node src/index.js --full`. Text-only on the
studio itself: `node src/index.js --no-mic`. Apply herdr config changes with
`herdr server reload-config`; undo key customization with `herdr config reset-keys`.

## Run manually

```bash
node src/index.js                      # current herdr session, mic on
node src/index.js --session voicelab   # a specific (e.g. sandbox) session
node src/index.js --no-mic             # text input only
node src/index.js --text               # text-only model output (no spoken replies)
```

`OPENAI_API_KEY` is read from the environment, else `./.env`, else
`~/repos/personal/homebase/.env.local`.

## Voice verbs

Fifteen curated tools rather than herdr's raw 89 API methods — realtime models pick far
more reliably from a small, well-named set.

| Tool | Says |
| --- | --- |
| `get_state` | "what's running?" |
| `create_space` | "new space called billing fix" / "…in the iris repo with claude" |
| `focus_space` / `rename_space` | "switch to payments", "rename this to auth" |
| `close_space` | "close payments" — **two-step, requires spoken confirmation** |
| `new_tab`, `split_pane`, `focus_pane`, `zoom_pane` | "split right", "zoom this" |
| `apply_layout` | "give me the agent and logs layout" |
| `start_agent` | "start a claude agent called reviewer in iris" |
| `prompt_agent` / `read_agent` | "tell reviewer to run the tests", "what is it doing?" |
| `run_command` | "run npm test here" |
| `notify` | "ping me when that's done" |

Spoken names are fuzzy-resolved to workspaces/agents, and project names resolve against
`~/repos` (so "the iris repo" becomes a real `cwd`).

## Safety

Reversible actions run immediately. Anything that kills running work (`close_space`)
requires a spoken confirmation first: the model asks, and the tool itself refuses
without `confirm=true`, so a misheard phrase cannot destroy a workspace.

## Testing against a sandbox

Never test against your live session. `scripts/sandbox.py` boots an isolated herdr
session with its own socket:

```bash
python3 scripts/sandbox.py voicelab      # separate session + socket
node test/e2e.mjs                        # 9 assertions against real herdr state
TCOLS=140 node test/tui-render.mjs       # TUI frame snapshot
```

The sandbox needs a properly-sized pty — herdr fails pane spawns with `ghostty error -2`
when the controlling terminal reports `rows=0/cols=0` (which `script -q /dev/null` does).

## Protocol notes (herdr 0.7.5, protocols 17–18)

- The socket API does not version requests. `ping` advertises the server protocol;
  protocol 18 retains the protocol 17 request shapes used here.
- Requests are **one-per-connection**: the server closes the socket right after
  responding. `events.subscribe` is the exception and streams until you disconnect.
- Read payloads nest under `read` (`res.read.text`), and `source: 'recent'` returns only
  output since the last read — use `visible` to see what's on screen now.
- Nested herdr is blocked unless `HERDR_ENV` is cleared.

## Realtime API notes

Verified live against `gpt-realtime-2.1`:

- `output_modalities` must be exactly `['audio']` **or** `['text']` — both is rejected.
  Audio mode still yields text for the TUI via `response.output_audio_transcript.*`.
- Function calls arrive **twice** (`response.function_call_arguments.done` and inside
  `response.done.output`) — dedupe by `call_id`.
- Sending `response.create` while a response is active errors with "conversation already
  has an active response in progress" — all response requests go through a gate.

## Microphone

The app filters **virtual audio devices** (Microsoft Teams Audio, BlackHole, loopback,
aggregate) and picks a real mic by preference (built-in MacBook mic, USB, AirPods,
Studio Display). If only virtual devices exist — the studio's situation — it reports
that honestly instead of silently capturing a dead input.

macOS gates mic access per-application: the first unmute (`tab`) in the floating window
triggers the system mic prompt for Ghostty — click Allow once. If no devices enumerate
at all, grant access in System Settings → Privacy & Security → Microphone and relaunch.

Check what's visible with:

```bash
ffmpeg -f avfoundation -list_devices true -i "" 2>&1 | grep -A5 "audio devices"
```

### Linux

Requires `ffmpeg` (mic capture and fallback playback) and `pipewire-audio` (playback server):

```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt install ffmpeg pipewire-audio
```

- **Microphone**: sources are enumerated with `pactl list sources`. Monitors
  (loopback sources capturing outputs) are filtered out. Capture runs through
  `ffmpeg -f pulse`. The device name `default` follows the desktop's own input
  selection; `PULSE_SOURCE` env var selects a specific source.
- **Playback**: `pacat` streams raw PCM directly into PipeWire with minimal
  buffering (~120 ms), keeping latency low and playback in order.
